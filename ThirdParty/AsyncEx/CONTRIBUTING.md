# Contributing to AsyncEx

:+1: Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :+1:

If you have encountered a bug (or just have a question on how to use the library), feel free to open an issue immediately. If reporting a bug, please include the version of AsyncEx you are using, your runtime platform and version, and code to reproduce the problem.

If you have an idea for code, or would like to contribute some code, the first step is to review the [design guidelines](doc/design.md). If your code falls within those guidelines, the next step is to open an issue for discussion. Finally, if the idea has been discussed and sounds like a good fit for AsyncEx, feel free to open a pull request. I know this is slow and annoying, but it makes me sad to close PRs that people put a lot of work into but don't fit in well with AsyncEx.

Our code of conduct is: be nice. Seriously, I don't think we need lawyer language. Just be nice. :blush:

That's it! Thanks again for contributing! :+1:
